===========================================

**DISCLAIMER** The original project was hosted in Google Code under https://code.google.com/archive/p/lego-mindstorms-3d-printing-machine/ which unfortunately closed and the project had to be moved here. 

So here is the original README from Google Code

# About
This is a project aims to develop a special 3D printer made of LEGO Mindstorms(R) pieces. Inspired by the GNU RepRap 3D Printer (open-source based 3D printer) and Arthur Sacek's Milling Machine, this project combines both techniques resulting in a machine that, even though resembles the RepRap design, it drills floral foam so as to make three dimensional objects. However, LEGO, as modular components, make the machine hybrid, with the capability of placing a specialized extruder instead of the milling bit.

The software is written in Java (implementing LeJOS NXJ API)

# Source Code
Current repository (@Google Code) is inactive. Please get a local copy by cloning the new repository on your machine.
```
git clone git://github.com/MaR1oC/lego-mindstorms-3d-printing-milling-machine.git
```

# Using the Makefile
Type `make help` to get a list of useful automated features CAUTION : Still in early development stage

# Purposes

This project aims to motivate people in the fields of art, computers & design. Moreover, as it's based on the GNU philosophy; it contributes in informing users about new technologies.

# Ideas
 * Use an RPi as a control unit and rewrite the code in python. Use nxt-python for direct commanding
 * Make alternate extruders
 * Improve bed
